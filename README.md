# zdom
small js library for dom element creation based on zen coding syntax
previous use of : for element text/attributes changed to `
this allows : to be used in element/attribute names as required to support namespace prefix
Can't use ` character due to affect on editors, try ^ character instead.
Also decouple all the form related stuff.
